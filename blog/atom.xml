    <title>Using GroupBy to remove 'data islands'</title>
    <updated>2021-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has dealt with measurement data knows, missing and errornous data is inevitable. Applying automatic quality control procedures can improve the data quality, however, due to the imperfect nature of such methods, the final dataset often contains many short periods of questionable data called ‘data islands’. In this blog post, I’ll show you how you can remove gappy sections of data and remove data islands using GroupBy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An introduction to the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSNR)</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ground measured irradiance data is often referred to as “ground truth”, due to being used as reference data for validating lesser accurate satellite derived and modelled irradiance data. However, making high-quality solar radiation measurements is expensive and requires weekly maintenance, hence only few of such stations exists, often operated by national meterological institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
